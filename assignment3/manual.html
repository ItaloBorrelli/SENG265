<h1>Vine Users Manual</h1>

<h3>What is the set of all SVG images which can be generated by <i>Vine</i>?</h3>
<p>
The <i>Vine</i> application creates an image of vines that spiral outward from a central point. There may be any number of vines spiraling out of the central point. Each vine may have sub-vines branching off from it, and those too may have their own sub vines; at each level, a random colour is assigned to the vines. Each sub-vine may be scaled up or down in comparison to it’s parent vine. The angle at which each sub-vine branches off of it’s parent may vary. Within an image, each vine is identical, but vines may vary from one image to another.
</p>
<p>
In addition, the vines in an image can be duplicated, creating multiple of the same vine within a single image. In addition, vines may have their colours swapped for other colours.
</p>
<p>
For example:
<ul>
<li>
<img src="vine0.svg" style="display: block; padding: 20px;">Vine 0</img> has five branches, each with a branching angle of 0.3 radians. Each branch is sized down by a factor of 0.6, and there are 5 levels of branches. The colours of each branch, from the innermost parent, are Deep Sky Blue, Light Steel Blue, Purple, Blue, and Dark Violet; these colours were assigned randomly.
<p><li>
<img src="vine1.svg" style="display: block; padding: 20px;">Vine 1</img> has three branches, each with a branching angle of 0.4 radians. Each branch is sized down by a factor of 0.8, and there are 4 levels of braches. The colours of each branch are Light Sky Blue, Silver, Dark Salmon, and Medium Aqua Marine, all chosen at random.
This image is also mirrored twice, once along the x-axis and once along the y-axis, so four identical vines appear in the image.
<p><li>
<img src="vine2.svg" style="display: block; padding: 20px;">Vine 2</img> has six branches, each with a branching angle of 0.6 radians. Each branch is sized down by a factor of 0.4, and there are 6 levels of braches. The colours of each branch are Wheat, Orchid, Lawn Green, Dark Green, Slate Gray, and Medium Slate Blue, all chosen at random.
This image is also mirrored three times, once along the x-axis and once along the y-axis, so eight identical vines appear in the image.
<p><li>
<img src="vine3.svg" style="display: block; padding: 20px;">Vine 3</img> has three branches, each with a branching angle of 0.3 radians. Each branch is sized down by a factor of 0.3, and there are 3 levels of braches. The colours of each branch are Red, Cyan, Dark Salmon, all chosen at random.
This image has had a colour swapped to red - Originally, the first colour was Aqua, and then it was changed after generation to red.
</ul>

<h3>What application(s) are supported by <i>Vines</i>?</h3>
<i>Vines</i> supports one application: <tt>App.sh</tt>.
<p>
To invoke <tt>App.sh</tt> from the Linux command line:
</p>
<pre>
	bash App.sh
</pre>
<p>
App.sh will prompt the user to choose the following options:
</p>

<ol>
	<li>Generate a new file, or edit an existing file?</li>
	<ul>
	<li>If generating a new file:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>What should the name of the file be?</li>
		<li>How many branches should the vine have?</li>
		<li>What is the branching angle in radians?</li>
		<li>What scale should each branch have to it's parent?</li>
		<li>To what depth should sub-branches be generated?</li>
	</ol>
	<li>If editing an existing file:</li>
	<ol>
		<li>What is the name of the file, excluding any extensions?</li>
	</ol>
	</ul>
	<li>Should this vine be mirrored?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If yes:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>Enter the number of times the image should be mirrored (NOTE: must be greater than zero)</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<li>Should this vine have any colours changed?</li>
	<ul>
		<li>If yes:</li>
		<ol>
			<li>What is the the name of the first colour that should be changed?</li>
			<li>What is the the name of the colour that it should be changed to? (NOTE: both must be valid colours as listed in css_colours.txt or css_colours_modified.txt)</li>
		</ol>
	</ul>
	<li>What should the final output file be named, excluding any extensions?</li>
</ol>
